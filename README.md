# My Portfolio Website - Overview üöÄ

This repository contains the open source version of my 3D portfolio website. Do check it out!

## Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

I have modified the GSAP club plugins with the trial plugins, but with the trial plugin, you cannot host it‚õîÔ∏è. For Club plugins, check out here: [GSAP Installation](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/).

**Techstack** - React, TypeScript, GSAP, ThreeJS, WebGL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Installation

   ```

3. Install React:

4. Install GSAP for React:

   You can choose to install GSAP specifically for React or the general GSAP package:
